## about
this is my personal website. it's built with wordpress. the theme is child theme based on the [ollie theme](https://github.com/OllieWP/ollie). this code is licensed under gpl3, meaning you can copy everything you want as long as it's only for open source software as well.

## how to download my theme and use it

- go to the folder `wp-content/themes`.
- see the folder `ollie`. download the folder with all the contents inside.
- see the folder `ollie-child-theme`. downlaod the folder with all the contents.
- go to your wp install and add `ollie` + `ollie-child-theme` to your `wp-content/themes` folder.
- in your wp admin dashboard, click 'appearance` option on the left bar.
- select "Ollie Child Theme".
- enjoy :)
